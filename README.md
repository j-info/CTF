I've decided to start creating some walkthroughs for CTF's as I go through them as a way to:

1) Reinforce my learning
2) Give back to the community

Hopefully you enjoy and find this resource useful if you get stuck while going through any of the ones I've completed and written up here.

Thanks for checking this out and I'll have more posted soon!
